### Introduction

DualMarker integrates multiple biological information sources and constructs a dual-layer heterogeneous network using fast network embedding. And we use a network enhancement method to denoise the constructed dual-layer heterogeneous network. Finally,we use network propagation algorithm to rank the features.

### Usage

To use DualMarker, follow the steps below: Load the ‘initavalue2.mat’ data. Run the ‘DualMarkerMainCode.m’ file to obtain feature ranking.
